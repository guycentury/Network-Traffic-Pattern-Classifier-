# Network-Traffic-Pattern-Classifier-
This Network Traffic Pattern Project will use a system that classifies network traffic sequences using DFAs. It'll model typical network behaviors like TCP handshake and repeated SYN attempts as formal languages. The program I will create will take a sequence of packet events as an input and determine which DFA (if any) accepts the sequence
